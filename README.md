This is the work I did for the Excella Coding Challenge 2016.

The format of the competition was two rounds. The first round was a variety
of code challenges similar to katas. The people who placed in the top half
of the first challenge were allowed into the second round which was to
create a WMATA app that told you which station to go to if you wanted
to go to your destination and what trains would take you that way. Judging
was done automatically with unit tests. I ended up tying for first in
the first round and then placing in second for the final round.
